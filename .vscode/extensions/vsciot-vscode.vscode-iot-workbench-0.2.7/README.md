#### Note: 
-  When invoking the **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Provision Azure Services...** command with Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, by default, Azure Functions would use the IoT Hub consumer group of `$Default`. To switch to another consumer group, please follow the [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) to create a new consumer group in Azure Portal. Then in IoT project, modify the following setting in **function.json**:
    ```
    "consumerGroup": "[consumer_group_name]"
    ```
-  You may open an existing IoT project after you close it. To do so:
    -  In the menu of **Visual Studio Code**, choose *File -> Open Workspace...* .
    -  In file selection panel, navigate to the folder that contains your project and select *{PROJECT_NAME}.code-project*.
