Welcome to the Visual Studio Code extension for **Arduino** <sup>preview</sup> ! The Arduino extension makes it easy to develop, build, deploy and debug your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code, with a rich set of functionalities. These include:

* IntelliSense and syntax highlighting for Arduino sketches
* Verify and upload your sketches in Visual Studio Code
* Built-in board and library manager
* Built-in example list
* Built-in serial monitor
* Snippets for sketches
* Automatic Arduino project scaffolding
* Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) integration of frequently used commands (e.g. Verify, Upload...)
* Integrated Arduino Debugging <sup>New</sup>

## Prerequisites
The Arduino IDE is required. Please install it from the [download page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software#download).
- *Note:* Arduino IDE `1.8.7` has some breaking changes, causing board package and library installation failures. It is recommended to that you install version `1.8.6` or `1.8.8`
- The supported Arduino IDE versions are `1.6.x` and later are supported.
- The Windows Store's version of the Arduino IDE is not supported because of the sandbox environment that the application runs in.

## Installation
Open VS Code and press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open command palette, select **Install Extension** and type `vscode-arduino`.

Or launch VS Code Quick Open (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>), paste the following command, and press enter.
```bash
ext install vscode-arduino
```

You can also install directly from the Marketplace within Visual Studio Code, searching for `Arduino`.

## Get Started
You can find code samples and tutorials each time that you connect a supported device. Alternatively you can visit our [IoT Developer Blog Space](https://aka.ms/iotdevblog) or [Get Started Tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-get-started).

## Commands
This extension provides several commands in the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) for working with `*.ino` files:

- **Arduino: Board Manager**: Manage packages for boards. You can add 3rd party Arduino board by configuring `Additional Board Manager URLs` in the board manager.
- **Arduino: Change Baud Rate**: Change the baud rate of the selected serial port.
- **Arduino: Change Board Type**: Change board type or platform.
- **Arduino: Close Serial Monitor**: Stop the serial monitor and release the serial port.
- **Arduino: Examples**: Show list of examples.
- **Arduino: Initialize**: Scaffold a VS Code project with an Arduino sketch.
- **Arduino: Library Manager**: Explore and manage libraries.
- **Arduino: Open Serial Monitor**: Open the serial monitor in the integrated output window.
- **Arduino: Select Serial Port**: Change the current serial port.
- **Arduino: Send Text to Serial Port**: Send a line of text via the current serial port.
- **Arduino: Upload**: Build sketch and upload to Arduino board.
- **Arduino: Upload Using Programmer**: Upload using an external programmer.
- **Arduino: Verify**: Build sketch.

## Options
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `arduino.path`  | Path to Arduino, you can use a custom version of Arduino by modifying this setting to include the full path. Example: `C:\\Program Files\\Arduino` for Windows, `/Applications` for Mac, `/home/<username>/Downloads/arduino-1.8.1` for Linux. (Requires a restart after change). The default value is automatically detected from your Arduino IDE installation path. |
| `arduino.commandPath` | Path to an executable (or script) relative to `arduino.path`. The default value is `arduino_debug.exe` for windows,`Contents/MacOS/Arduino` for Mac and `arduino` for Linux, You also can use a custom launch script to run Arduino by modifying this setting. (Requires a restart after change) Example: `run-arduino.bat` for Windows, `Contents/MacOS/run-arduino.sh` for Mac and `bin/run-arduino.sh` for Linux. |
| `arduino.additionalUrls` | Additional Boards Manager URLs for 3rd party packages. You can have multiple URLs in one string with a comma(`,`) as separator, or have a string array. The default value is empty. |
| `arduino.logLevel` | CLI output log level. Could be info or verbose. The default value is `"info"`. |
| `arduino.enableUSBDetection` | Enable/disable USB detection from the VSCode Arduino extension. The default value is `true`. When your device is plugged in to your computer, it will pop up a message "`Detected board ****, Would you like to switch to this board type`". After clicking the `Yes` button, it will automatically detect which serial port (COM) is connected a USB device. If your device does not support this feature, please provide us with the PID/VID of your device; the code format is defined in `misc/usbmapping.json`.To learn more about how to list the vid/pid, use the following tools: https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport `npm install -g serialport` `serialport-list -f jsonline`|
| `arduino.disableTestingOpen` | Enable/disable automatic sending of a test message to the serial port for checking the open status. The default value is `false` (a test message will be sent). |
| `arduino.skipHeaderProvider` | Enable/disable the extension providing completion items for headers. This functionality is included in newer versions of the C++ extension. The default value is `false`.|
| `arduino.defaultBaudRate` | Default baud rate for the serial port monitor. The default value is 115200. Supported values are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 74880, 115200, 230400 and 250000 |

The following Visual Studio Code settings are available for the Arduino extension. These can be set in global user preferences <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> or workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`). The latter overrides the former.

```json
{
    "arduino.path": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Arduino",
    "arduino.commandPath": "arduino_debug.exe",
    "arduino.logLevel": "info",
    "arduino.enableUSBDetection": true,
    "arduino.disableTestingOpen": false,
    "arduino.skipHeaderProvider": false,
    "arduino.additionalUrls": [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VSChina/azureiotdevkit_tools/master/package_azureboard_index.json",
        "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json"
    ],
    "arduino.defaultBaudRate": 115200
}
```
*Note:* You only need to set `arduino.path` in Visual Studio Code settings, other options are not required.

The following settings are as per sketch settings of the Arduino extension. You can find them in
`.vscode/arduino.json` under the workspace.

```json
{
    "sketch": "example.ino",
    "port": "COM5",
    "board": "adafruit:samd:adafruit_feather_m0",
    "output": "../build",
    "debugger": "jlink",
    "prebuild": "bash prebuild.sh"
}
```
- `sketch` - The main sketch file name of Arduino.
- `port` - Name of the serial port connected to the device. Can be set by the `Arduino: Select Serial Port` command.
- `board` - Currently selected Arduino board alias. Can be set by the `Arduino: Change Board Type` command. Also, you can find the board list there.
- `output` - Arduino build output path. If not set, Arduino will create a new temporary output folder each time, which means it cannot reuse the intermediate result of the previous build leading to long verify/upload time, so it is recommended to set the field. Arduino requires that the output path should not be the workspace itself or in a subfolder of the workspace, otherwise, it may not work correctly. By default, this option is not set.
- `debugger` - The short name of the debugger that will be used when the board itself does not have a debugger and there is more than one debugger available. You can find the list of debuggers [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino/blob/master/misc/debuggerUsbMapping.json). By default, this option is not set.
- `prebuild` - External command before building the sketch file. You should only set one `prebuild` command. `command1 && command2` does not work. If you need to run multiple commands before the build, then create a script.

## Debugging Arduino Code <sup>preview</sup>
Before you start to debug your Arduino code, please read [this document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) to learn about the basic mechanisms of debugging in Visual Studio Code. Also see [debugging for C++ in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_debugging) for further reference.

Make sure that your Arduino board can work with [STLink](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html), [Jlink](https://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html) or [EDBG](http://www.atmel.com/webdoc/protocoldocs/ch01s01.html). The debugging support is currently fully tested with the following boards:
- [MXChip IoT Developer Kit - AZ3166](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/)
- [Arduino M0 PRO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardM0PRO)
- [Adafruit WICED WiFi Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3056)
- [Adafruit Feather M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3010)
- Arduino Zero Pro

Steps to start debugging:
1. Plug in your board to your development machine properly. For those boards that do not have an on-board debugging chip, you need to use a STLink or JLink connector.
2. Go to the **Debug View** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>). and set breakpoints in your source files.
3. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to select your debugging environment.
4. When your breakpoint is hit, you can see variables and add expression(s) to watch on the Debug Side Bar.
